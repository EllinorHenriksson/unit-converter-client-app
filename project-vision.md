# Project vision
The purpose of Unit Converter - a webbapplikation - is to offer the end users the possibility to easily make conversions between units of different measurement types. It will offer simple functionality such as converting one measurement to a different unit, but also more advanced functionality such as converting several meaurements of the same type into a single measurement of a certain unit. Apart from pure conversions, the end users will also be able to compare measurements of different units to see if they are equal or if one measurement is greater or less than the other measurement. As for conversions, the comparison tool will also offer more advanced functionality by letting the user compare several measurements as a whole to other measurements.
